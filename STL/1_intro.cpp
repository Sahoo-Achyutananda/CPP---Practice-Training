/*
STL - Standard Template Library
    -> Consists of inbuilt data structures and other components and functions.
    -> Data structures define the way data will be stored. Data should be stored in a manner that they can be retrieved effectively
    and efficiently.

    # Components of STL:
        1. Algorithms
        2. Containers - they are template classes (i.e. generic classes)
            -> Sequence containers ()
            -> Container adapters
            -> Associative Containers
        3. Iterators - they are available for every container

        o Containers :
            1. Sequence containers -
                - array
                - vector
                - list(doubly linked list)
                - forward_list(singly linked list)
                - deque
            2. Derived containers/ Container adaptor - 
                - priority_queue
                - stack
                - queue
            3. Associative containers - 
                - set(array of unique elements)
                - multiset(allows duplicates)
                - map(data is stored in key:value pair. Uses hashtable)
                - multimap(keys can be repeated but their values cannot be)
